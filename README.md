Overall it is a single page web app, it firstly loads the cards of books, if you click one of the cards it shows that book's details on the green part. If you want to add a new book you can easily use the form below. It is fully responsive, can look nice on mobile as well.

<code>npm run dev or yarn run dev</code>
